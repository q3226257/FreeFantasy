pylletTown
==========

pylletTown is a [TMX](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/wiki/TMX-Map-Format) based demo of the video game [Pok√©mon Red/Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue) running in python 3.
I created it as a working showcase for my fork of the pygame TMX library that I've [ported from python 2.x to python 3](https://github.com/RenfredH04/tmx). The library allows for easy implementation and customization of tile based maps like the ones contained in this demo.

Installation of [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/install.html) and any version of [python3](http://www.python.org/getit/) is required to run this demo
